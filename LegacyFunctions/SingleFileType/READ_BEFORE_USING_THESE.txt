These funtions are VERY old, when I (L) coded them i was not nearly as proficient as I am now. Please carefully check the results if you must use these as I cannot garuantee the results will be accurate.

I highly recommend at least using ImportScope(), this whilst legacy should be fine for data import. Ideally you should use ScopeTrace() it is more memory efficient, and contains lots of extra tricks. ScopeTrace() also integrates with LightGate() and PDVAnalysis() tools allowing some very neat workspaces.
